# Active Context: github-workhours

## Current Focus
Improving the accuracy of after-hours commit analysis

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use JavaScript instead of TypeScript for broader accessibility
- Chosen to support both CLI and programmatic interfaces
- Selected Personal Access Tokens as the authentication method
- Determined JSON as the primary output format
- Adopted functional clean architecture with single-purpose functions in separate files
- Decided to use factory functions for dependency injection (e.g., `makeUser`)
- Implemented a 2D array [7][24] for day-hour tracking to improve code readability and analysis accuracy
- Defined work hours as 9am to 5pm in the local timezone of the server
- Enhanced CLI with shorthand time period notations (y, mo, w, d) for natural language date parsing

## Current Challenges
- Optimizing GitHub API usage to handle large organizations
- Designing an efficient caching strategy for commit data
- Balancing between detailed analysis and performance
- Handling timezone differences in commit date analysis

## Next Steps
- None at this stage
