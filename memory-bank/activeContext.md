# Active Context: github-workhours

## Current Focus
Documentation for configuration and caching strategies

## Recent Decisions
- Decided to use JavaScript instead of TypeScript for broader accessibility
- Chosen to support both CLI and programmatic interfaces
- Selected Personal Access Tokens as the authentication method
- Determined JSON as the primary output format
- Adopted functional clean architecture with single-purpose functions in separate files
- Decided to use factory functions for dependency injection (e.g., `makeUser`)

## Current Challenges
- Optimizing GitHub API usage to handle large organizations
- Designing an efficient caching strategy for commit data
- Determining the most useful metrics for after-hours analysis
- Balancing between detailed analysis and performance

## Next Steps
- None at this stage
